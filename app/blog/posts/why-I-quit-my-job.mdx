The job market is brutal right now, and many people I know are struggling to land internships or full-time roles. That’s why having something great lined up after graduation felt like a huge deal to me. I want to share why this opportunity mattered so much—and why I ultimately decided to walk away from it.

Whatnot isn’t the most talked-about company on the outside, but inside? It’s a rocket ship. The kind where, if you just stick around long enough, you’re almost guaranteed to do insanely well—especially with the stock. I interned there, saw the crazy growth firsthand, and knew immediately: this was the place to be. It wasn’t just the numbers; the culture was incredible too. So when they offered me a full-time role, I didn’t even bother recruiting elsewhere.

I wasn’t making quant money, but I was more than happy with the initial compensation. Let’s be real—$226K (~₹2Cr) is pretty solid for someone fresh out of college, especially for someone who grew up in a developing country. Back in India, I used to see numbers like that in newspaper articles about success stories, never imagining I’d be in that position one day.

When I got my return offer, I saw my dad’s face light up in a way I’d never seen before. For him, it felt like the quarter-million he invested in my education had finally “paid off.” Moving to the U.S. for college was a massive risk, but it turned out to be the best decision I ever made. None of it would have been possible without my parents’ support, so seeing them proud meant everything to me.

So why leave?

Because deep down, I knew I wasn’t built for a traditional career. Since middle school, I’ve been obsessed with startups—watching Justin Kan, Garry Tan, and those old Y Combinator vault videos. I still remember sitting in my grandfather’s car in 2015, watching a video about Twitch’s founding story while he went to buy groceries. He passed away in 2018, and I wish he were here today. He would’ve been so, so proud.

Since then, my life has revolved around one thing: learning how to build, get people to use what I make, and—most importantly—get them to pay for it. I’ve had my fair share of wins and even more failures. But every project, late-night build, and rejection email has prepared me for this moment.

Two weeks ago, something happened that still feels surreal—one of my childhood dreams came true.

I’m incredibly proud to announce that my new company, sixtyfour.ai, is now backed by Y Combinator as part of its first-ever Spring batch.

I’m going all in. No backup plans, no half-measures—this is it. Everything I’ve learned up to this point has led me here, and I’ve never been more excited for what’s ahead.
